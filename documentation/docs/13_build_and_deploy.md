Build and deploy
================

This page describes how to build a custom version of OpenERP for Windows.

Building
--------

### Dependencies

The first step is to build the dependencies. To do so, grab the Windows installer branch:

    bzr branch lp:~openerp-groupes/openerp/win-installer-trunk

and install the packages:

-   7z465.msi
-   python-2.5.2.msi
-   setuptools-0.6c9.win32-py2.5.exe
-   Beaker-1.4.1.tar.gz
-   Mako-0.2.4.tar.gz
-   pytz-2010l.win32.exe

#### Server

Install the packages:

-   lxml-2.1.2.win32-py2.5.exe
-   PIL-1.1.6.win32-py2.5.exe
-   psycopg2-2.2.2.win32-py2.5-pg9.0.1-release.exe
-   PyChart-1.39.win32.exe
-   pydot-1.0.2.win32.exe
-   python-dateutil-1.5.tar.gz
-   pywin32-212.win32-py2.5.exe
-   PyYAML-3.09.win32-py2.5.exe
-   ReportLab-2.2.win32-py2.5.exe

#### Web

Install the packages:

-   Babel-0.9.4-py2.5.egg
-   CherryPy-3.1.2.win32.exe
-   FormEncode-1.2.2.tar.gz
-   simplejson-2.0.9-py2.5-win32.egg
-   xlwt-0.7.2.win32.exe

### Source distribution

The second step is to build a source distribution on Linux.

#### Server

Let's assume you work on your own server branch named **6.0** and you want to build a server with the following modules:

-   base\_setup
-   base\_tools
-   board

This implies that these modules have been linked in *bin/addons* by a command similar to:

    ln -s ~/openerp/addons/6.0/{base_setup,base_tools,board} .

To build the server, go to the root directory and type:

    python setup.py sdist --format=zip

You now have a new file in the **dist** directory, called openerp-server-M.m.P.zip where:

-   **M** is the major version, example 6
-   **m** is the minor version, example 0
-   **p** is the patch version, example 1

#### Web

To build the web client, go to the root directory and type:

    python setup.py sdist --format=zip

You now have a new file in the **dist** directory, called openerp-web-M.m.P.zip where:

-   **M** is the major version, example 6
-   **m** is the minor version, example 0
-   **p** is the patch version, example 1

### Binary distribution

The third step is to build a binary distribution on Windows.

#### Server

Open a command prompt and unzip the file:

    7z x openerp-server-M.m.P.zip -oC:\openerp

Go to the **win32** directory:

    cd C:\openerp\openerp-server-M.m.P\win32

Generate the service exe with:

    python setup.py py2exe

Go to the parent directory:

    cd ..

Generate the server exe with:

    python setup.py py2exe

Build the Windows installer with:

    makensis setup.nsi

You now have a new file in the root directory, called openerp-server-setup-M.m.P.exe. This file is the installer that you can use the install a custom version of OpenERP.

#### Web

Open a command prompt and unzip the file:

    7z x openerp-web-M.m.P.zip -oC:\openerp

Go to the **win32** directory:

    cd C:\openerp\openerp-web-M.m.P\win32

Generate the service exe with:

    python setup.py py2exe

Go to the parent directory:

    cd ..

Generate the web exe with:

    python setup.py py2exe

Build the Windows installer with:

    makensis setup.nsi

You now have a new file in the root directory, called openerp-web-setup-M.m.P.exe. This file is the installer that you can use the install a custom version of OpenERP.

Deploy
------

This page describes how to deploy a custom version of OpenERP on Windows.

### Package script

The first step is to grab the package script branch:

    bzr branch lp:~openerp-groupes/openerp/package-script

### Batch

Go to the *packaging* directory of the branch and copy the file *build.bat* to the *C:\\openerp* directory of your Windows machine.

### SSH server

You need to install a SSH server on Windows. You can for example install [freeSSHd](http://www.freesshd.com/).

### Fabric

You need to install the tool [Fabric](http://docs.fabfile.org/0.9.3/) to run commands on Windows from Linux using SSH. Refer to your linux package manager to install it.

#### Configure

Go to the *packaging* directory of the branch and edit the file fabfile.py. Change what need to be changed.

#### Run

run the command:

    fab -H host -u user server

where:

-   *host* is the Windows host name
-   *user* is the Windows user name
