I18n - Internationalization
===========================

Explain about the multiple language application

Introduction
------------

The I18n contains the translation of module in different languages. The folder contains two type of files .po and .pot. The .po files are the actual translation files where as .pot is the template for the translation.

The .po files should be named according to the language code of specific language and .pot should be named according to the module name.

Example of a account.pot file

    "Project-Id-Version: OpenERP Server 5.0.0\n"
    "Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: support@openerp.com\n"
    "POT-Creation-Date: 2009-05-19 14:36+0000\n"
    "PO-Revision-Date: 2009-05-20 10:36+0000\n"
    "Last-Translator: <>\n"
    "Language-Team: \n"
    "MIME-Version: 1.0\n" 
    "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
    "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"
    "X-Launchpad-Export-Date: 2009-12-07 15:06+0000\n"
    "X-Generator: Launchpad (build Unknown)\n"

    #. module: account
    #: code:addons/account/account.py:0
    #, python-format
    msgid "Integrity Error !"
    msgstr ""

The above file is the template for the translation files for the account module they tell what all values of the module should be translated in the respective languages.

Example of fr\_FR.po for account module translates in French language

    # Translation of OpenERP Server.
    # This file contains the translation of the following modules:
    #     * account
    #
    msgid ""
    msgstr ""
    "Project-Id-Version: OpenERP Server 5.0.0\n"
    "Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: support@openerp.com\n"
    "POT-Creation-Date: 2009-05-19 14:36+0000\n"
    "PO-Revision-Date: 2010-01-04 11:19+0530\n"
    "Last-Translator: Anup <ach@tinyerp.co.in>\n"
    "Language-Team: \n"
    "MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
    "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
    "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"
    "X-Launchpad-Export-Date: 2009-12-07 15:07+0000\n"
    "X-Generator: Launchpad (build Unknown)\n"

    #. module: account
    #: code:addons/account/account.py:0
    #, python-format
    msgid "Integrity Error !"
    msgstr "Erreur d'Intégrité !"   

The above file translates the values of msgid to French in msgstr. Based on the msgid present in the .pot file. fr\_FR is the language code for French language in which fr specifies the language and FR specifies the country in which the language is spoken.
